# Asteroids3D (Work in progress)

It's a 3D space game based on the classic 2D arcade game Asteroids.
Made with WebGL.

This is a 2-person final assignment for a Computer graphics course at the University of Iceland.

Run the game by opening the Asteroids3D.html file in a browser, but bear in mind, the game is still under development.
